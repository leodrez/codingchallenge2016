#Codetrotters Fellowship Coding Challenge Summer 2017


##About

**[Codetrotters Fellowship](http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship)** 
links promising developers with global startups so they
can get invaluable real life experience.

As part of the application process we post a coding challenge every year, and this year's applications will be accepted through February 15th, 2017. 

You can read more about the Codetrotters *Fellowship* at [http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship](http://www.codetrotters.com/fellowship)


##Participating in the Challenge


To participate in this challenge, you need a *GitHub* account. Fork this repository *and* once you finish with your solution, *send* us a Pull Request.

We are looking forward to reading all your solutions!

##Challenge

### Medalla BAC Calculator

You will build a calculator for measuring Blood Alcohol Concentration based on weight, number of Medallas consumed, and the amount of time that has passed since consumption.  You can build such a program using any language you choose.

*Yeah.  Helpful for weekends on the beach in PR.*

##Exercise Requirements

* Prompt user for their weight (lbs), the total number of Medallas they have consumed, and the amount of time that has passed since drinking (hours)
* Use this information to calculate the BAC of the person
* Return that number (BAC) to the User

You can be as technical or non-technical as you want with this exercise.  If you want to truly model a BAC calculator, there are formulas out there that you can find on Google.  An example of such a formula is below:

```
BAC% = (A × 5.14/W × 0.69) - .015 × H 
Where:
  A: Total alcohol consumed, in ounces (oz)
  W: Body weight, in pounds (lbs)
  H: Time passed since drinking, in hours
```

If you want to use the above formula, you'll have to determine how many ounces (oz) of alcohol are in 1 medalla.  But it should be straightforward after modifying the formula for that!
